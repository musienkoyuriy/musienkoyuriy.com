- *Targeting advertising systems*
- *Multi-lingual search engines*
- *Multitenancy e-commerce systems*
- *Seed-to-Sale platforms*
- *ETL systems*.
- *Open source component libraries and tools developers utilities*

Technologies such **Golang**, **Javascript** and ecosystem around them successfully helps me to deliver my solutions.
