I'm passionate software engineer with focus on creating accessible interfaces and secure APIs. The main experience I gained in client-side development for enterprise applications using **Angular** but non-stop researching allows me to easily switch to different technologies within the JS ecosystem. Also I build an APIs using **Golang**.

Managed to work in areas such as: cargo transportation processes for airlines, targeting advertising systems, multi-lingual search engines, multitenancy e-commerce systems, seed-to-sale operations etc.

By the way I also [*create open source*](https://github.com/musienkoyuriy).
