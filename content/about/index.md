I am experienced and passionate software engineer with focus on creating accessible interfaces and secure APIs. As for commercial products the main experience I gained in development of client-side for enterprise applications using **Angular** but non-stop researching allows me to easily switch to different technologies within the JS ecosystem. Also I build an APIs using **Golang**.

Managed to work in areas such as: cargo transportation processes for airlines, targeting advertising systems, multi-lingual search engines, multitenancy e-commerce systems, seed-to-sale operations etc.
